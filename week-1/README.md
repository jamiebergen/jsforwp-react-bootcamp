# React Bootcamp: Week 1

This is to demonstrate building a simple one-page website with a static header, footer and main content area. We are using React and JSX. The html-templates folder contains versions of the same basic html markup using either React.createElement or JSX. Notice that the same markup requires much more code if using React.createElement.

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html)
* [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
* [MDN Document and website structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure) - Used as a model for proper HTML markup

## Caveats

* A real React app would not link directly to React, ReactDOM, and Babel from script tags.
* A real React app would import separate files for each component.
